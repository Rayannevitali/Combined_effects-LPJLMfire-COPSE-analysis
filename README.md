## Model Use

The analyses in this repository use the following models:

| Model | Description | Repository / DOI |
|-------|-------------|-----------------|
| **COPSE** | Carbon-Oxygen-Phosphorus-Sulfur-Evolution model, with updates for this manuscript including fire and photorespiration feedbacks. | [Zenodo DOI / GitHub link] |
| **LPJ-LMfire** | Dynamic global vegetation model used to generate forcing data for fire feedbacks. | [Zenodo DOI / GitHub link] |

> See the model repositories for full documentation, source code, and usage instructions.
